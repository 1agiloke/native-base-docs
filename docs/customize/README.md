# Customize

Customizing [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) will be a cakewalk for you. That is due to the fact, [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) has categorized its screens into different sections. It provides separate set of files for customizing each component.<br />

**Note:** *[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is built on top of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).<br />*
*Hence with any component you can pass the style property which will be merged to the default style of that component.<br /><br />*
