## Theme Font

Having different font types in your [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps is not tough any more.<br />
[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) provides you with a set of nine font families.<br />


* To include these fonts into your app, go to **Themes/myTheme.js**
* Replace value for <code>fontFamily</code> with your choice of font name.


Font families included with NativeBase:
* Andale Mono
* Arial
* Arial Black
* Chalkboard
* Cochin
* Comic Sans MS
* Courier New
* Devanagiri
* Georgia
* Microsoft Sans Serif
* Skia
* Times New Roman


NativeBase allows you to add more font styles on your own.
